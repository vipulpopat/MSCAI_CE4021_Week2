    "\n",
    "Calculation of derivative of a polynomial function with one variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**** Approach ****\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a polynomial function it will be necessary to take the equation as an input string.  This will allow the correct representation of derivatives the include + and - operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first group of functions are _helper_ functions to assist with parsing, determine if a string value represents a number, and to properly represent a valid number as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Modifications from Reflection ***\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant change came from **Brian Parle's** feedback.  He correctly pointed out that the functions were performing mixed operations - both string processing and calculations.  This broke the concept that a function should do one thing (and hopefully do it well). To that end I modified the parsing capability to return non-string values for processing.  This greatly simplified the calculation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledgement also goes to **Martin Power** as his comment called out the idea of using pairs consisting of coefficient and power.  I was part of the way down this road, but while examining his code it clarified the approach I wanted to take myself.  I had intended to take it further but it was far exceeding the requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, acknowledgement to **Vipul Popat** for his extremely elegant code.  Having provided some feedback on his approach I tested my own initial code a little further and realised I too didn't handle some of the edge cases.  This led to specific logic to catch cases such as constants, empty strings and (unstated)coefficients of 1."
