    "### Problem Statement: \n",
    "Calculate the derivatives of the functions provided in Derivatives.docx.\n",
    "- Verify your results by writing one or more Python functions that operate on \n",
    "   polynomial functions with one variable. \n",
    "Please use the template Python notebook available in your gitlab repository (Week2 project).\n",
    "Hint: You can represent a polynomial function using only its coefficients. \n",
    "      For example, you could decide to represent 5x3+7x2+3x+6 as [5,7,3,6] \n",
    "      with the exponent of x implied by the position in the list. \n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "Using Test Driven Development, incrementally build out the solution to ensure additional test cases pass\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 1: Handle the case \"a\", where 'a' is a constant(numerical only) - derivative is 0\n",
    "#Step 2: Handle the case \"ax^n\", where x is raised to the power n. result = 'nax^n-1'\n",
    "#Step 3: Add the ability to handle a full equation - use a list of tuples where each list \n",
    "         entry is a constant/power pair.\n",
    "         Problem here is how to assert two lists are equal \n",
    "         - I eventually used a solution using unittest assertEqual\n",
    "           (some of the setup for using unittest I got from Cormac Lavery's submission)\n",
    "Advantage with my solution is that exponent is not dependent on the position in the list\n",
    "i.e. I can process in any order: 3x^2 + 6x^3 or "
