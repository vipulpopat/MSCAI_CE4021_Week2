    "# Calculate the derivatives of the functions provided in Derivatives.docx.\n",
    "# - Verify your results by writing one or more Python functions that operate on \n",
    "#   polynomial functions with one variable. \n",
    "# Please use the template Python notebook available in your gitlab repository (Week2 project).\n",
    "# Hint: You can represent a polynomial function using only its coefficients. \n",
    "#       For example, you could decide to represent 5x3+7x2+3x+6 as [5,7,3,6] \n",
    "#       with the exponent of x implied by the position in the list. \n",

    "#Step 1: Handle the case \"a\", where 'a' is a constant(numerical only) - derivative is 0\n",
    "#Step 2: Handle the case \"ax^n\", where x is raised to the power n. result = 'nax^n-1'\n",
    "#Step 3: Handle the case \"ax^n\", where x is a negative power. x=x^n where n=1, and the dx = a. \n",
